				<h>Leaders of Men</h>
				<p>The Officers that lead light infantry are an altogether different group of men. Resourceful, dedicated, skilled at subterfuge, these expert soldiers know how to formulate a strategy and execute it with only a handful of men, and improvise when the plan goes awry. While some officers furnish their command at personal expense, others are more interested in accumulating wealth during their service.</p>
				<h>Superior Officer</h>
				<p>Members of light infantry companies are given a wide latitude, often encouraged to pick their own target and plan of attack. This laissez-faire approach increases flexibility in the field but can lead to some troubling notions. Troops accustomed to operating independently may grow reluctant to follow the chain of command — and make no mistake, you are the authority while deployed. Your men would do well to listen when the officers in the party speak.</p>

				<list>
					<li>
						<b>Ability Score Increase.</b> One ability score of your choice increases by 2.</li>
